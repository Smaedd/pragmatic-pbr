# Pragmatic PBR - HDR

This blog post is a part of series about implementing PBR in WebGL from scratch:

1. [Intro](http://marcinignac.com/blog/pragmatic-pbr-intro)

## What is HDR?

Traditional images (e.g. your average JPG photo) represent RGB color values as numbers from 0..255 (or 0..1 in GLSL) for each Red, Green and Blue component. This is not how light behaves in real life e.g. sunshine is 1000s times brighter than a lightbulb. In oder to fit the lighting information (pixel brightness / color) into that LDR (Low Dynamic Range) space some of the information has to be lost. That's clearly visible when you take a photo against the sun and suddenly everything else is black or the opposite you focus on your face but the whole background is overexposed and white.

![](img/300_hdr.jpg)

HDR - High Dynamic Range images on the other side allow you to store image data with values above 255. That allows you to capture both the dark and bright areas at the same time. We can then adjust the exposure of the photo in realtime to focus on the desired range or apply process called tonemapping to avoid over or under exposing the image.

## 301-load-cubemap ([code](https://github.com/vorg/pragmatic-pbr/blob/master/301-load-cubemap/main.js))

One of the best source of HDR images are so called environment maps. They fully capture the environment around you not only at 360' but also above and below.

We can represent an environment as a cube surrounding the viewer hence the name of such textures in WebGL : *CubeMaps*. Below you can see a cross representation of a CubeMap with 6 sides facing the axes X, Y and Z.

In the GPU memory the faces are represented as a 2D textures in the following order:
<span style="color:red">+X</span>,
<span style="color:red">-X</span>,
<span style="color:green">+Y</span>,
<span style="color:green">-Y</span>,
<span style="color:blue">+Z</span>,
<span style="color:blue">-Z</span>.
Therefore it would be a bit cumbersome to upload such a texture to the GPU in a cross representation so a better way is to load all the faces separately.

#### Cubemap Orientation

There is only one problem. If you look carefully at the animation of the folding cube you will notice that <span style="color:blue">+Z</span> side of the cube is facing away from us. In WebGL the convention is that <span style="color:blue">+Z</span> should face towards the viewer. We call that orientation right handed because if you count on your right hand 1,2,3 for X,Y,Z starting from your thumb you your fingers will form an orthogonal basis with the Z axis pointing towards you.

![](img/301_cube_orientation.png)

Cubemaps spec comes from the time when RenderMap ruled the world and Renderman it's using Left-Handed Coordinate system so do the cubemaps. That means to we will need to flip the X axis in our shader whenever we sample from a CubeMap texture. Additionally you will need to point your camera towards <span style="color:blue">+Z</span> instead of the usual <span style="color:blue">-Z</span> in order to start at expected direction. Otherwise you might end up looking at the wall like in case of the Pisa texture we are using.

The Pisa texture comes from [High-Resolution Light Probe Image Gallery
](http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Data/HighResProbes/) but it doesn't specify where exactly it was taken. I've been struggling so much with "should I flip Z or X?" that I decided to find the source and decide once and for all what's left and what's right.

#### Loading the CubeMaps

Here is how load the CubeMap in PEX:
```javascript
Window.create({
    settings: {
        width: 1024,
        height: 576,
        fullscreen: isBrowser
    },
    resources: {
        //first we load 6 images, one per face
        envMap_px: { image: ASSETS_DIR + '/envmaps/pisa_posx.jpg' },
        envMap_nx: { image: ASSETS_DIR + '/envmaps/pisa_negx.jpg' },
        envMap_py: { image: ASSETS_DIR + '/envmaps/pisa_posy.jpg' },
        envMap_ny: { image: ASSETS_DIR + '/envmaps/pisa_negy.jpg' },
        envMap_pz: { image: ASSETS_DIR + '/envmaps/pisa_posz.jpg' },
        envMap_nz: { image: ASSETS_DIR + '/envmaps/pisa_negz.jpg' },
    },
    init: function() {
        //then we create cubemap texture
        //we specify face index to match the +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z order
        this.envMap = ctx.createTextureCube([
            { face: 0, data: res.envMap_px },
            { face: 1, data: res.envMap_nx },
            { face: 2, data: res.envMap_py },
            { face: 3, data: res.envMap_ny },
            { face: 4, data: res.envMap_pz },
            { face: 5, data: res.envMap_nz }
        ])
    }
})
```

#### Reflections

Today we will focus only on specular (sharp) reflections on mirror like surfaces (e.g. polished chrome ball). From the [law of reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics) we know that for such surfaces the reflected ray `R` will bounce of the surface at the same angle as the incoming ray `I` relatively to the surface normal `N` so `θ₁ == θ₂`

![](img/301_reflection_angle.png)

In GLSL we can use built-in function `reflect` that is implemented as follows:

```glsl
vec3 reflect(vec3 I, vec3 N) {
    return I - 2.0 * dot(N, I) * N;
}
```

Note: Why substraction? Both ``-N*dot(N, I)`` and `N` seem to point in the same direction... Yes but but `dot(N, I)` is negative here e.g for the vectors above:

```javascript
I = [0.7, -0.7, 0.0]
N = [0.0,  1.0, 0.0]
dot(N, I) = -0.7
```

Not that we know how to reflect vectors we can see that there are two possible scenarios. Either the view ray from the camera will hit the object and bounce back or will continue until hitting the skybox surrounding the scene.

Therefore we will need two shaders. One for the Skybox and one for the Sphere (or any other reflective surface).

It's important to remember in which coordinate space we calculate our reflection. Normals are usually in the view (eye) space and it's easy to calculate view ray (eyeDir) in view space as the camera position is `[0,0,0]` so we just negate the vertex position. But the cubemap textures are addressed in the world space so we need to move our computation there.

Full source for the reflection shader.

*301-load-cubemap/Reflection.frag:*
```glsl
//envMapCube samples a cubemap envmap by mirroring the sampling ray along X axis
#pragma glslify: envMapCube  = require(../local_modules/glsl-envmap-cube)

uniform mat4 uInverseViewMatrix;
uniform samplerCube uEnvMap;

varying vec3 ecPosition;
varying vec3 ecNormal;

void main() {
    //direction towards they eye (camera) in the view (eye) space
    vec3 ecEyeDir = normalize(-ecPosition);
    //direction towards the camera in the world space
    vec3 wcEyeDir = vec3(uInverseViewMatrix * vec4(ecEyeDir, 0.0));
    //surface normal in the world space
    vec3 wcNormal = vec3(uInverseViewMatrix * vec4(ecNormal, 0.0));

    //reflection vector in the world space. We negate wcEyeDir as the reflect function expect incident vector pointing towards the surface
    vec3 reflectionWorld = reflect(-wcEyeDir, normalize(wcNormal));

    gl_FragColor = textureCube(uEnvMap, envMapCube(reflectionWorld));
}
```

For the skybox the shader is much simpler.

*301-load-cubemap/Skybox.vert:*
```glsl
//Matrix uniforms go here
//...

varying vec3 wcNormal;

void main() {
  //we will use skybox position as it's normal
  wcNormal = aPosition.xyz;
  gl_Position = uProjectionMatrix * uViewMatrix * uModelMatrix * aPosition;
}
```

*301-load-cubemap/Skybox.frag:*
```glsl
#pragma glslify: envMapCube  = require(../local_modules/glsl-envmap-cube)

varying vec3 wcNormal;

uniform samplerCube uEnvMap;

void main() {
    gl_FragColor = textureCube(uEnvMap, envMapCube(normalize(wcNormal)));
}
```

You can play with the live version that includes debug mode showing the sides of the cube and third person view showing you the whole scene.
